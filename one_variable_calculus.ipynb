    "Possibly the most important concept of _calculus_, at least of _differential calculus_  is the concept of __derivative__. Oversimplifying, derivatives are calculations of the rates of changes. Although the idea is rather simple, they have numerous properties, both earthbound and extraterrestrial. Whereas the concept of a derivative goes back to the ancient Greek, by the work of Euclid and Archimedes in circa 300&ndash; 300 BC, as creators of the modern calculus are considered _Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz_ and _Sir Isaac Newton_, independently. \n",
